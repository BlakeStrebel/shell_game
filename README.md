# Shell Game Project #
Northwestern University ME495: Embedded Systems in Robotics (Fall 2016)
Team members: Elton Cheng, Adam Pollack, Blake Strebel, Vismaya Walawalkar  
Instructor: Jarvis Schultz

## Overview ##
The purpose of this project was for Baxter to play a [shell game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_game) with the user. The game involves tracking the location of a hidden 'treasure' under three identical cups. The user shows the treasure to Baxter, places it under one of the cups, and shuffles them randomly on the workspace. Baxter uses a camera in one of his hands to track the cups, and, whenever the user is done shuffling, he picks up the cup containing the treasure.
